# Diamond Price Prediction

This project aims to predict diamond prices using a linear regression model. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from a dataset containing diamond information.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository.

3. Run the notebook cells to execute the code step by step.

## About the Project

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Import Libraries**: Import necessary libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.

2. **Import Data**: Load the diamond dataset from the provided source.

3. **Data Exploration**: Display initial information about the dataset to understand its structure.

4. **Swap Columns**: Define a function to swap the positions of two columns in the dataset.

5. **Data Preprocessing**: Convert categorical features into numerical representations. Scale the features using Min-Max scaling.

6. **Feature and Target Variables**: Define the feature matrix and the target vector.

7. **Train-Test Split**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

8. **Train Model**: Train a Linear Regression model using the training data.

9. **Prediction and Evaluation**: Predict diamond prices using the trained model and evaluate its performance.

10. **Visualization**: Plot the predicted values against the actual values for visualization.
