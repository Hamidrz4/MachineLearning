# Linear Regression Example

This is a simple example of using linear regression to predict a target variable based on a single feature. The dataset used in this example consists of data points and corresponding target values.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository.

3. Run the notebook cells to execute the code step by step.

## About the Example

The example demonstrates the following steps:

1. **Import Libraries**: Import necessary libraries including pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

2. **Define Arrays**: Create arrays for the feature and target variables.

3. **Create DataFrame**: Convert the arrays into a pandas DataFrame with proper indexing.

4. **Split Dataset**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function.

5. **Plot Data**: Visualize the training and testing data points using scatter plots.

6. **Define Model**: Create an instance of the Linear Regression model.

7. **Train Model**: Train the model using the training dataset.

8. **Predictions**: Generate predictions on the testing dataset.

9. **Visualize Predictions**: Plot the training and testing data along with the model's prediction line.

10. **Create Reports**: Create dataframes for reporting training and testing results.

11. **Dataframe Operations**: Perform operations on the created dataframes, including data type details, column selection, and record access.

12. **Dataframe Concatenation**: Combine the training and testing dataframes for comparison.
