# Decision Tree Classifier Example

This script demonstrates the use of a Decision Tree Classifier for binary classification using the provided tumor dataset.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Decision Tree Classifier Example! This script showcases how to load a dataset, preprocess it, train a Decision Tree Classifier, evaluate its performance, and visualize the decision tree.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the script:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `pandas`, `numpy`

You can install the required libraries using: `pip install scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy`

### Running the Script

1. Import the required libraries at the beginning of the script.
2. Make sure the dataset URL is correct and accessible.
3. Run the script. The script will load the dataset, preprocess it, train a Decision Tree Classifier, and visualize the decision tree.

## Features

- Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Train a Decision Tree Classifier.
- Evaluate the classifier's performance using classification reports.
- Visualize the decision tree using a tree plot.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this example is sourced from the provided URL:
[Dataset URL](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-ML241EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/datasets/tumor.csv)

## Usage

1. Run the script by executing `python your_script_name.py`.
2. The script will load the dataset, train a Decision Tree Classifier, and display the classification reports and a visual representation of the decision tree.
