## Introduction

Logistic Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for binary and multi-class classification tasks. In this project, we apply Logistic Regression to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their features.

## Code Overview

### Importing Libraries

Import the necessary libraries and modules for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

### Loading and Preprocessing Data

Load the Iris dataset and split it into features and target variables. Preprocess the data by splitting it into training and testing sets.

### Training the Logistic Regression Model

Create a Logistic Regression model with specified hyperparameters and fit it to the training data.

### Confusion Matrix Visualization

Visualize the confusion matrix using seaborn's heatmap and mlxtend's plot_confusion_matrix.

### Classification Report and Metrics

Generate a classification report including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. Calculate and display the overall accuracy and F1-score.

## Results

The Logistic Regression model demonstrates its ability to classify Iris flowers with high accuracy and provides insights into the performance of the classification for each class.
