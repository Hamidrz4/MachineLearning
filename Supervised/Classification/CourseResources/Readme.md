Machine Learning Course Resources
This repository contains course resources for two comprehensive machine learning courses: one from FaraDars and the other based on the "Data Science with Python" book. The courses are divided into three parts: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Ensemble Learning with Advanced Topics. Each course aims to provide a thorough understanding of machine learning concepts, techniques, and practical implementation.

FaraDars Machine Learning Courses
Course 1: Supervised Learning
In this course, we delve into the foundations of supervised learning techniques. We cover fundamental concepts and algorithms used for predicting outcomes based on labeled training data. The course curriculum includes:

Introduction to Supervised Learning
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees and Random Forests
Support Vector Machines
k-Nearest Neighbors
Naive Bayes Classification
Model Evaluation Metrics
The associated resources include lecture slides, code examples, assignments, and quizzes to reinforce your understanding.

Course 2: Unsupervised Learning and Ensemble Learning with Advanced Topics
In the second course, we explore more advanced aspects of machine learning, focusing on unsupervised learning and ensemble methods. Additionally, we cover advanced topics to broaden your knowledge and skills. The course curriculum includes:

Introduction to Unsupervised Learning
Clustering Algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)
Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
Ensemble Learning (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking)
Anomaly Detection
Imbalanced Data Handling
Hyperparameter Tuning
Model Deployment and Ethics
The resources provided for this course include in-depth lecture materials, hands-on code demonstrations, practical exercises, and case studies.

Data Science with Python Book's Code
This section of the repository provides Python code implementations for the examples and exercises presented in the "Data Science with Python" book. The code covers a wide range of machine learning topics, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. You can find code notebooks organized by chapter, making it easy to follow along with the book's content.
