# Machine Learning Course Resources

Welcome to the Machine Learning Course Resources repository. Here, you will find an assortment of valuable materials for two comprehensive machine learning courses: one developed by FaraDars and the other based on the "Data Science with Python" book. These courses are designed to equip you with a solid understanding of machine learning concepts, techniques, and practical applications. The content is divided into two main parts: Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning with Advanced Topics.

## FaraDars Machine Learning Courses

### Course 1: Supervised Learning

Dive into the foundational aspects of supervised learning techniques. This course introduces fundamental concepts and algorithms used to predict outcomes from labeled training data. The course curriculum covers the following topics:

- Introduction to Supervised Learning
- Working with Data
- Model Evaluation Metrics
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks (MLP)
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees 



### Course 2: Unsupervised Learning and Ensemble Learning with Advanced Topics

Delve deeper into the world of machine learning with a focus on unsupervised learning and ensemble methods. This advanced course also delves into additional topics to enhance your knowledge and skills. The course curriculum covers the following subjects:
 
- Naive Bayes Classification
- KNN
- Ensemble Learning (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking)
- Feature Selection
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
- Clustering Algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)
- Association Rule Mining


## Data Science with Python Book's Code

This repository also includes Python code implementations for examples and exercises from the "Data Science with Python" book. The provided code covers a wide spectrum of machine learning topics, ranging from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and visualization. The code notebooks are organized by chapters, making it simple to follow along with the content of the book.
